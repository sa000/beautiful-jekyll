title: Minimizing intradivional travel in the NBA
---

Scheduling is an incredibly complex problem in the sports world. Each 
unique sports presents it's own issues that schedulers have to deal. For the NBA, scheduling 82 games for each of the 30 teams is already a beast. However the difficulty is introduced by trying to minimize distances traveled by the team to reduce fatigue, balancing strength of scheduling as well as trying to reduce back to backs. Not to mention other logistical constraints such as overlapping the games with other events the stadiums might be holding. Furthermore, compressing that into the October-April season, as well as trying choosing prime match ups to host on national tv, and now even hosting matches in other countries has introduced more complications. 


One of the main goals in improving scheduling is to obviously reduce fatigue amongst players. However with a long 82 game season, it's hardly viable to have such consistency. There are many interesting subproblems that come in this space of scheduling. Minimizing distance traveled by teams, maximizing revenue, ensuring equal strength of schedule for everyone, etc. One interesting subproblem is finding the perfect allocation of teams to divisions. Given that a team faces it's rivals in it's division 4x, you ideally want the divisions close to each other. I.E It wouldn't make sense to have portland and philadelphia in the same division.

John Mitchell at RPI explored this subproblem and solved as a graph theory proble,  [the k way equipartition problem](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/77b9/440e2f6c4c5bdfedc64cad8478b4b7f4f94c.pdf). I though it be a fun excercise to explore this problem as not only have have team relocations(Seattle--->Oklahoma, New Jersey--->Brooklyn), but also of exploring how divisions might change if the NBA were to expand to 32 teams. With potential rumors of Seattle getting a team again, as well as potentially Vancouver, a realignment will be needed. 



## k Way Equipartition Problem

In essence, this problem is essentially describing: Partition the 30 teams in the league into 6 divisions of 5 teams such that we minimize distance travel between divisions. However, given that you play a teams in a division more, I'd like to explore a modification of this problem and explore to minimize distance within a division the overall intradivisional distance. We can view this as an integer programming formulation.

First, let's clearly define our definition, minimizing the intradivisional distance. Let's take the northwest division

We wish to minimize all overall distance for all the divisions. However, there are so many combinations to organize a division, how do we choose? Let's look at the integer formulation.


## Integer Formulation
To think of our formulation, we need to think of our variables. We have 30 teams, and 6 potential divisions to allocate them, resulting in 180 variables. Naturally, these can only 0-1 value, a team either belongs in a diviion or it doesn't. What about our minimization? We need to minimize the distances in the division, so we have to characterize this somehow. We can create a route variable, r, to be 0 or 1 to represent if two teams play each other. We want only want this route to be activated if two teams are in the same division. Now let's recap our formulation:

* Optimization:
	- Minimize distances of routes:
* Constraints:
	- Each division can only have 5 teams
	- Each team must belong to one of 6 divisions
	- If two teams are in one division, the route between these two teams must be activated.

The great thing about linear programming formulations is once we have our objective function(what we want to optimize) and our constraints, we can translate this to the math below.

## Difficulty
 

However as detailed by this paper this problem is NP-Complete. Recall the NBA is solving even much harder formulation. To get a better understanding why this is difficult, let's look at a small example. What if we the league was just 6 teams, and we wanted 3 divisions? Graphically it would like as shown.

<img src="/img/example.png" />


Where each node represents a team, and we have a fully connected graph. A team can only travel to all other n-1 teams. To form our division, we want the degree of each node to be k-1, where k is the number of divisions. The weight of the edges will direct the construction of our division. Even for this example, there are so many possibilities we could have chosen! When running trying to formulation on my computer for all 30 teams, even after a **couple days** I could not solve it. This is due to naively solving it as an integer program. A clever approach would be as Mitchell solves in the paper, relaxing the problem as a linear program, adding cycle inequalities, new constraints etc. 


## Approach
To avoid such complications, I decided to solve it through a different approach, inspired by this [randomized min cut algorithm](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs161/cs161.1166/lectures/lecture15.pdf)


<img src="/img/mincut.png" />

For this problem, you essentially generate a random cut of the graph and continously run it and keep track of the minimim of said cut. By running it more times, you increase the probability of obtaining the min cut after n runs. While it's obviously more complex than that, we only need take the idea of randomness.

We can randomly assign teams to 6 divisions. Then minimize said divisions by continously swapping teams to lower the overall mininum distance if possible. Run this n times and keep track of the best solution. 

* while swaps_made>0:
   * swaps_made=0
   * for each team i:
		* find parter team j such that swapping the teams i,j to the other division lowers the overall intradivisional distance:
			* take the best team j that lowers the distance the most
			* swaps+=1
		* If there is a partner:
			* swap(i,j)
		* else:
			* do nothing
If no swaps can be made, that means we have the best alignment of our division, for the intiail randomized set of divisions. Similiarly for min cut, I ran this a bunch of times to get the best alignment of divisions, which when we look at the results makes sense.


## Results

First let's look at the current alignment of divisions by the NBA. For ease of reading, Brooklyn has been removed and there is only one of the Los Angeles teams is represented. Given the proximity, Brooklyn and New York will always be in the same division and same with the L.A Lakers and the L.A Clippers.

Now let's look at the optimal results.

For the most part, they are mostly the same but a few differences.
* Washington, Southeast --> Atlantic
* Toronto, Atlantic --> Central
* Milwaukee, Central --> Northwest 
* Oklahoma City, Northwest --> Southwest 
* New Orleans, Southwest --> Southeast 

The differences could be due to the fact Seattle relocated to Oklahoma. As mentioned, the NBA is factoring thousands of other factors. But even so, these divisions can be used to help guide the scheduling of when each team, as we can for sure see some distance is being saved travel wise.

More importantly, this gives us a great foundation to explore how would the NBA look if we added back Seattle and let's say Vancouver.

Given that we have 32 teams, one solution is to transition into 8 divisions, giving us the following.

For the future, I hope to keep this type of approach. Partly out of laziness I hand write my math instead of latex, but I also feel it gives it a less "formal" look. As ultimately, I just want to be able to communicate dense topics better for others to understand and explore interesting problems in the league. Below is the relevant literautre referenced.
