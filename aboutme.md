My name is Sakib Alam. I have a B.S in Applied Math, and a M.S in Computational & Applied Math but a basketball lover as well. This blog is just to explore some interesting problems that exist in the basketball space but also explore the math behind the scenes. Ultimately, these posts are just a fun mental excercise to explore basketball analytics and hopefully convey complex ideas in a technical but also clear way.
